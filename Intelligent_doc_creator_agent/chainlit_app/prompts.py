DOCUMENT_INTENT_PROMPT = """You are analyzing user intent in a conversation about document creation.
You are classifying the user intent to help an agent determine how to proceed with the conversation.
This agent is only capable of conversational interaction and creating documents. IT DOES NOT CREATE ANYTHING APART FROM DOCUMENTS.

Input information:
- Conversation history: $CONVERSATION_HISTORY$
- Current user input: $USER_INPUT$
- Previous classified intent critiques to be considered for refinement: $INTENT_CRITIQUE$

Definitions:
- "Document" refers to a structured piece of content with a clear purpose, such as a Research paper, MSc thesis, PhD Thesis, or some academic type of document.
- "Explicit request" means the user has clearly indicated they want a document created using phrases like "create," "write," "draft," "make," "generate," or direct mention of document types.
- "Specific topic" means a clearly defined subject matter that provides sufficient context for document creation AND is suitable for academic exploration in a research paper, thesis, or scholarly document. Phrases like "about" or "regarding" without an actual subject are NOT considered topics.

Classification Rules (in order of precedence):
1. If the user is selecting or referring to a specific option from a previously provided list → 'SELECT_FROM_OPTIONS'
   - Example: "I like option 2" or "Let's go with the third innovation idea"
   - The selection must reference a specific item from a list presented in the conversation history
   - Include any modifications the user requests to the selected option in your reasoning

2. If the user explicitly requests document creation AND provides a specific topic → 'DOCUMENT_REQUEST_WITH_TOPIC'
   - Example: "Create a document about renewable energy" or "Write a thesis on quantum computing"
   - The topic must be clearly identifiable, specific enough to create academic content around, and appropriate for research papers, theses, or scholarly documents
   - Incomplete requests like "I want to create a document about" with no specific subject after "about" do NOT qualify
   - Non-academic topics that wouldn't be suitable for research papers or theses do NOT qualify
   - Extract the exact topic in your reasoning (not just the prepositions like "about" or "on")

3. If the user's input is conversational, unclear, incomplete, or does not contain an explicit document request → 'NORMAL_CONVERSATION'
   - Example: "Tell me more" or "What options do you have?" or "asdasdojkçln"
   - This is the default classification if neither of the above criteria are met
   - IMPORTANT: Requests that start a document request but don't complete it (e.g., "Create a document about" with nothing following) should be classified here
   - Requests for documents about topics not suitable for academic research should be classified here

Handling Ambiguous Cases:
- If the user combines multiple intents (e.g., selects an option AND requests a new document), select 'NORMAL_CONVERSATION' and ask for clarification on what exactly they want, as it is not really clear.
- If unsure whether a topic is specific enough or academically appropriate, classify as 'NORMAL_CONVERSATION' and note this in your reasoning
- Consider any $INTENT_CRITIQUE$ to refine your understanding of edge cases in this specific conversation
- Be careful to distinguish between prepositions/connecting words and actual topics (e.g., "about," "regarding," "on" are not topics by themselves)
- Never EVER assume a topic that was not explicitly specified.

Before giving your final answer, provide your step-by-step reasoning that explicitly addresses each classification possibility.

Response format:
CLASSIFICATION: [CATEGORY_NAME]
REASONING: [Your step-by-step analysis that considers each classification option]"""


INTENT_CRITIQUE_PROMPT = """Perform a step-by-step in-depth analysis of the intent classifier's output based on the user's input and conversation context.
Your goal is to validate correctness, identify errors, provide a substantive critique, and score the intent classifier's performance.

Input information:
- Conversation history: $CONVERSATION_HISTORY$
- Current user input: $USER_INPUT$

---
### **Updated Classification Rules** (For reference)
1. If the user is selecting or referring to a specific option from a previously provided list → 'SELECT_FROM_OPTIONS'
   - Must reference a specific item from a list in the conversation history
   - Should capture any requested modifications to the selected option

2. If the user explicitly requests document creation AND provides a specific topic → 'DOCUMENT_REQUEST_WITH_TOPIC'
   - Must contain clear document creation language AND an identifiable topic
   - The topic must be specific enough to create content around
   - The topic must be suitable for academic exploration in a research paper, thesis, or scholarly document
   - Prepositions and connecting words (e.g., "about," "on," "regarding") without an actual subject are NOT topics
   - Incomplete phrases like "Create a document about" with nothing following should NOT qualify
   - Non-academic topics that wouldn't be suitable for research papers or theses should NOT qualify
   - Never EVER assume a topic that was not explicitly specified.

3. If the user's input is conversational, unclear, incomplete, ambiguous or lacks an explicit document request → 'NORMAL_CONVERSATION'
   - This is the default classification when criteria for other categories aren't fully met
   - Includes incomplete document requests where the topic is missing or unclear
   - Includes requests for documents on non-academic topics

---

### **Evaluation Criteria**
Evaluate the intent classifier's output on these specific dimensions:
1. **Classification Accuracy**: Is the final classification correct based on the updated rules?
2. **Reasoning Process**: Did the classifier follow proper steps and consider all classification options?
3. **Topic/Option Extraction**: Was the correct topic or selected option accurately identified?
   - Did the classifier distinguish between actual topics and connecting words/prepositions?
   - Did the classifier verify that the topic is suitable for academic research?
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Did the classifier appropriately handle ambiguity, incomplete requests, or mixed intents?

---

### **Scoring Guidelines (0-100%)**
- **90-100%** = Correct classification WITH complete, accurate reasoning and proper extraction
  - Example: Right category, followed all steps, correctly identified topic/option
  
- **75-89%** = Correct classification WITH partial reasoning or minor extraction issues
  - Example: Right category, followed most steps, but missed nuances in topic/option extraction
  
- **50-74%** = Correct classification BUT significant reasoning errors OR incorrect extraction
  - Example: Right category, but skipped important analysis steps or extracted wrong topic
  
- **25-49%** = Incorrect classification BUT reasonable reasoning process
  - Example: Wrong category, but the reasoning shows understanding of most relevant factors
  
- **0-24%** = Incorrect classification AND flawed reasoning process
  - Example: Wrong category with missing steps or completely misunderstood user intent

---

### **Common Error Cases to Watch For**
- Mistaking prepositions or connecting words ("about," "regarding," "on") as the actual topic
- Classifying incomplete requests as 'DOCUMENT_REQUEST_WITH_TOPIC' when no specific topic is provided
- Failing to identify incomplete user inputs that need clarification
- Accepting non-academic topics that wouldn't be suitable for research papers or theses

### **Output Format**
observation: [DETAILED CRITIQUE addressing each evaluation criterion and explaining specific strengths/weaknesses]
recommendations: [SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS for improving the intent classification process]
